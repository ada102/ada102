- 🧑‍🎓 Currently learning python ; WIP : 
- 1️⃣ a web service to measure the impact of the inflation of materials in contruction works in France, based on INSEE BT index variation. CODENAME = WEBSHA. I already built this service on excel, CODENAME=SASHA
- 2️⃣ a web service to measure if a household is concerned by a specific law text in France - premier quartile de ressources des demandeurs de logement social. CODENAME=QUAHLM. I already built this service on excel and bubble.io. CODENAME=CALCULETTE QUARTILE
- 3️⃣ a web service using Spotify API to create a playlist based on the user's choice ; eg: create a playlist for a specific bpm  range in my liked songs. CODENAME=SPLAY I have to start this one from scraches.
